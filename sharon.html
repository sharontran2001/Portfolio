<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hey there! My name is Sharon Tran, I am currently a student at KIPP: San Jose Collegiate. I am born and raised in San Jose, California. I love to bake, play basketball, dance, and learn new things. I dislike papaya, bugs, snakes.
One fun fact about me is that I love everything about Korea, for example, KPOP, KDRAMA, Korean beauty products, and more!</p>

<li> Based on what I've learned so far, some similarities between Python and Scratch is that they both are scripts that makes the code function. Specifically, the deal with conditionals, loops, functions, script, numbers, and etc. Some difference is that Scratch is given as written code, but as a block, while Python is writing out the code. </li> 

<li> How I felt learning how to write python code is a little confused. I really enjoyed writing out the code and run it to see the output. Honestly, I find it difficult to understand. </li>
