  <h2> GWC Reflection Week 2 Day 2 </h2>

  <ol>
  
<li> Based on what I've learned so far, some similarities between Python and Scratch is that they both are scripts that makes the code function. Specifically, the deal with conditionals, loops, functions, script, numbers, and etc. Some difference is that Scratch is given as written code, but as a block, while Python is writing out the code. </li> 

<li> How I felt learning how to write python code is a little confusing. I really enjoyed writing out the code and run it to see the output. Honestly, I find it difficult and intimidated because their were alot of numbers, special symbols, and etc.</li>
